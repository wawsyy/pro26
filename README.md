# Demo26 Project

This is a comprehensive FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) project collection demonstrating various applications using Zama's fhEVM technology.

## Project Structure

- `pro26/` - Main power usage tracking application with FHE
- `fhevm-hardhat-template旧/` - Legacy FHE counter template
- `zama-9/` - Collection of 40+ FHE demonstration projects
- `zama-9/SecretBox/` - Secure data storage application

## Features

- Fully Homomorphic Encryption integration
- Decentralized application development
- Privacy-preserving computations
- Smart contract development with Hardhat
- React-based frontend interfaces

## Getting Started

Each project contains its own README with setup instructions. Navigate to the specific project directory and follow the local documentation.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) applications built on Zama's fhEVM platform. Each project demonstrates different use cases and implementation patterns for privacy-preserving blockchain applications.

## Architecture

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts compiled with FHEVM
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js applications with modern UI
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites for both local and testnet environments
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment scripts with verification
